# Text-Analysis-Project

For Part I, I wanted to explore Wikipedia’s data source, to pull relevant keywords from the Airbus A350-900 page. The goal was to create a histogram with a title using associated keywords from the wikpedia article source. So that anyone exploring my program would be able to easily understand a lot about the A350-900 and important terms associated with the aircraft, airlines, incidents and innovations. I used the Mediawiki to pull data and used the return statement to create the histogram.  

 

The goal with the search for news related to Polygon, MATIC. My favorite blockchain project, that we use within my start-up to power a large portion of our tech-stack. The implementation was to gather the title, url for related articles and allow for adjustments to be made for the search page. Initially, I wanted to provide more than just the link and a title displaying when sorting by “relevancy” but quickly realized, that these two pieces of information themselves were showing the two most important thinking factors for a user. 
I used ChatGPT to simplify my program’s process and to make the article text within a single string.

I did not perform any visualizations within my programs. But used mediawiki and the newsapi to pull together valuable data to meet my program’s intended outcomes.  
To provide valuable information on the Airbus A350 and Polygon search articles.  

Above shows the terminal output display of all Airbus A350 related wikipedia pages with the title using relevant key words. Below it, a singular string of articles related to Matic, Polygon sorted by relevancy.  

From the process point of view. I could improve the way I brainstorm my program and structure my process. As of now, I do not follow a step-by-step process and instead go by what I can do now. I believe, I was able to create a relevant program with Polygon (MATIC) giving user’s an easy way to search relevant news related to Polygon. I did not have a testing plan in mind. ChatGPT helped me refine my code and understand whether my process and thinking were good or bad. It guided me to have a better overview of the step-by-step process. And helped me prevent mistakes I was going to make along the way. 

For future projects. I want to lay out all my variables and functions I might have to create along the way. Before writing the code, I want to plan each section within my program to understand if it meets my intended outcome or at least has a logic. I will use ChatGPT as an assistant, to help me guide my thinking and processes.
